You can try uploading files, but they'll just end up with me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

This is a Google Script app for file submission. I wrote it in high school as part of my position on the competitive programming club. Members were participating in coding challenges online and we kept track of how many points each one earned so we could form a leaderboard. 

They would specify on the html form what problem they completed and gave a quick description of it, which was uploaded to Drive as metadata for the file they attached (their code submission). 

I've used this for other "dropbox/submission" type forms in the past as well for other clubs. The html isn't pretty by any means but it got the job done for what I needed at the time :)
